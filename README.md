You are an expert UI/UX and frontend engineer. I have an existing HTML/CSS project for an e-commerce site exporting Nigerian products to the U.S. Below is my current file structure and a high-level description of what each file does. Your task is to **enhance** my UI/UX—using ONLY my existing files (add new ones only if absolutely necessary), follow my naming conventions, and keep CSS modular. Deliver code diffs or updated files with clear comments.

### 2. Goals & Constraints
1. **Responsive & Mobile-First**: Use media queries in `base.css` and `layout.css` to ensure all pages adapt down to 320px width.
2. **Afrocentric but Modern**: Leverage my CSS variables (`--primary-green`, `--accent-ochre`, etc.) to reflect Nigerian heritage without bloating CSS.
3. **UI Components**: Improve buttons, form fields, product cards, navbar, and modal dialogs (e.g. cart preview) for best practice accessibility (ARIA roles, focus states).
4. **Performance**: Keep HTML semantics intact. Use CSS transforms/animations sparingly (e.g. smooth hover states), optimize image loading (native `loading="lazy"`).
5. **Minimal New Dependencies**: No new CSS frameworks. You may suggest tiny utility classes or a single CSS file if needed.

### 3. Specific Tasks
- **Navbar & Hero** (`index.html`):  
  - Collapse menu into a hamburger on ≤768px.  
  - Add subtle slide-in animation for mobile menu.  
- **Product Listing** (`products.html`):  
  - Add sticky filter sidebar on desktop, and a slide-in filter modal on mobile.  
  - Improve product-card grid: show 4 columns on ≥1200px, 3 on ≥900px, 2 on ≥600px, 1 on smaller.  
- **Product Detail** (`product-detail.html`):  
  - Implement an image gallery with thumbnail selector and zoom-on-hover.  
  - Style “Add to Cart” form with quantity selector plus/minus buttons.  
- **Checkout Flow** (`cart.html`):  
  - Add step-by-step progress bar (Cart → Address → Payment → Review).  
  - Style form inputs with error states and inline validation messages.  
- **Vendor Dashboard** (`vendor-dashboard.html`):  
  - Turn static tables into responsive cards on mobile.  
  - Add a sidebar toggle and collapsible sections for Orders / Inventory.  

### 4. Deliverables
- Updated CSS (or new partials) with annotated comments.  
- HTML diffs or full updated files.  
- Short explanation of each change and why it improves UI/UX.  
- A final summary of any newly added classes, variables, or components.

### 5. Tone & Best Practices
- Write clean, DRY CSS. Use BEM or my existing naming style.  
- Comment EVERY non-trivial section of CSS/HTML.  
- Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus outlines.  
- No inline styles—keep layout in CSS files.

Please proceed step by step, starting with the **navbar and hero section** in `index.html` and `css/layout.css`. Show me the HTML/CSS diff, then explain.
