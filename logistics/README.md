# Logistics App

## Migration Issue Resolution

### Problem
The initial migration for the logistics app was failing with the error:
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: table "delivery_partner" already exists
```

This happened because the tables were already created manually using the `create_logistics_tables.py` script, but Django was trying to create them again through migrations.

### Solution
We modified the initial migration to be empty (no operations), which allowed Django to mark the migration as applied without trying to create the tables again.

### Future Considerations
1. **Avoid mixing manual table creation with Django migrations**:
   - Either use Django migrations for all table creation
   - Or use manual SQL scripts and mark migrations as applied using `--fake` flag

2. **If you need to add new tables or modify existing ones**:
   - Create new migration files using `python manage.py makemigrations logistics`
   - These will build on top of the existing tables

3. **If you encounter similar issues in the future**:
   - You can fake a migration using `python manage.py migrate app_name migration_name --fake`
   - This marks the migration as applied without running it
