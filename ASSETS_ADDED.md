## Audio Files Added
The following audio files have been downloaded from SoundBible and added to the project:

- `success.mp3` - Ding sound for successful actions
- `info.mp3` - Notification sound for information alerts
- `error.mp3` - Error sound for error alerts

## Process
1. Created a Python script (`download_assets.py`) to download the assets
2. Downloaded the assets from Unsplash and SoundBible
3. Ran `collectstatic` to copy the assets to the static files directory

## Next Steps
1. **Test the Website:**
   - Verify that the AJAX functionality works correctly
   - Check that no 404 errors appear in the console

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R to force a refresh of the page and its resources

3. **Customize Further:**
   - Replace these placeholder images with actual product images specific to your African food products
   - Adjust the audio files if needed to match your brand's tone

## Script Used
The `download_assets.py` script was created to automate the download process. It uses the requests library to download files from URLs and save them to the appropriate directories.

## Maintenance
To add more assets in the future:
1. Place them in the appropriate directories under `afriapp/static/`
2. Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to update the static files
